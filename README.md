# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
This weeks challenge helps us build upon our skills learned in the Excel module. In a short amount of time, Louise's play fever came close to reaching its fundraising goal. The purpose of this analysis was because we were tasked to find out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
The overview of the analysis is well described with screenshots (2 pt).
The analysis had two tasks. First, a pivot table was created to show the Theater outcomes by launch date. To make sure it was the right data, we filtered for the theater criteria in the parent category. Next, we showed the "successful", "failed", and "canceled" projects by month. A line chart was created for the results, as shown below.

Challenges or difficulties that were encountered, and how they were overcome, are well explained. If there were no difficulties, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered (2 pt).
One of the most difficult tasks for me from this project was filtering the correct data from the required 'subcategories' when doing the countif function. I overcame this following the tutorials in the module 1 to get the correct Outcomes based on Goal graphs.
## Results
Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date (2 pt).
One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals (2 pt).
There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for additional tables or graphs (2 pt).
