# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
The purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).
The purpose of this analysis is to find out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
The overview of the analysis is well described with screenshots (2 pt).
Challenges or difficulties that were encountered, and how they were overcome, are well explained. If there were no difficulties, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered (2 pt).
One of the most difficult tasks for me from this project was filtering the correct data from the required 'subcategories' when doing the countif function. I overcame this following the tutorials in the module 1 to get the correct Outcomes based on Goal graphs.
## Results
Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date (2 pt).
One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals (2 pt).
There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for additional tables or graphs (2 pt).
